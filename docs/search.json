I used historical stock price data downloaded from an online financial API and processed it using Python.\nThe goal of the task was to understand how stock prices fluctuate over time and how trends, peaks, and drops can be identified visually. Instead of only looking at raw numbers in a table, plotting the data as a graph makes it much easier to see patterns, such as upward trends, sudden drops, or periods of high volatility.\n\n\n\n\nI chose a line graph because:\n\nIt is the best way to show changes over time.\nIt clearly highlights trends, such as rising or falling prices.\nIt allows easy comparison between different time periods.\nFinancial data like stock prices is continuous, so connecting points with lines makes sense.\n\nBy using a line graph, viewers can quickly understand how the stock behaved during this period and identify important movements, such as when the price increased sharply or dropped suddenly.\n\nThis visualization demonstrates how numerical data can be transformed into a clear visual story, making complex financial information easier to understand."

The saxophone produces sound when air passes through a reed and vibrates inside the instrument.\nI enjoy playing the saxophone because:\n\nIt has a warm and expressive sound\n\nIt can play both melody and harmony\n\nIt is used in many styles of music\n\nLearning to play the saxophone requires good breath control, finger coordination, and practice. Over time, I have improved my ability to read music, keep rhythm, and perform in front of others."
