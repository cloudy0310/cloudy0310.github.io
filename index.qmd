Hello! My name is Cloud Lee, and this is my personal website. I am a second-year student at SIT studying Applied Computing (FinTech). 

I created this website to showcase my projects, experiences, and reflections on using GenAI tools for learning and project development.


I have a strong interest in:

- Software development
- Financial technology
- Data analysis and visualization
- Front-end and UI/UX design

This website showcases my academic journey, selected projects, and reflections on using GenAI tools in my learning.
